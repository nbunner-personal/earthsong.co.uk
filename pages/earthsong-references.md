<blockquote><p style="color: #6a2300;">“Earthsong deliver a lively, interactive session, which is very “hands on” for all children. They are particularly sensitive at working with children who are not very confident, and encouraging them to be involved at a level they are confident with.</p>
<p style="color: #6a2300;">One of our children was very shy and did not want to join in. Earthsong were great at encouraging him in a really sensitive way, showing great awareness of his needs, and by the end of the session he was happily drumming with the rest of the children.</p>

<p>From a teacher to organiser of ‘Music Appreciation Concerts’…</p>

<blockquote style="color: #29297d;"><p>“I wanted to let you know that at Fossdene today we had Angela and Storme back from Earthsong for the day to do a workshop for the little ones in Nursery, Reception and Year 1.  They all had such a fantastic time!  They loved it, they were playing drums, marimbas, lots of other percussion instruments and even got them dancing with Chinese Lion costumes.  They did counting activities, rhythm games, listening, conducting and performing as ensemble groups and making a really great sound!</p>

<p>It was really wonderful!  Their rapport with the children was really wonderful also.</p>

<p>All the teachers were really impressed and it was useful for giving ideas of activities to do with the children in music lessons as they are specialists in World Music.</p>

<p>I am so glad we got to know them last year through the Music Appreciation Concerts which were for KS2 children, but wanted to let you know how excellent they were also with the younger children as I would highly recommend them to other schools.”</p>

<blockquote><p style="color: #800000;"><em>“A rather belated note to say thank you so much for all your hard work last week.
The children really enjoyed the sessions and there has been really positive feedback from staff, parents and children.
The enjoyment on the children's faces in the photos I took are testament to the week's success!”</em></p>

<h3>TEACHERS INSET</h3>
<p>“Earthsong Music has been delivering ‘Developing music with children’ workshops for childcare providers here at Hounslow. We have had approx. 200 people in attendance to the workshops and the demand still continues to grow. The Music workshops delivered by Angela and Storme truly are an inspiration. The sessions are fun and enlightening and have captivated staff. Attendees can’t wait to get back to their nurseries and get the children clapping and singing to such a lovely sound of drums, beats and tunes.</p>  

<p>Angela and Storme have been delivering workshops for us for over two years now initially starting with a beginner’s session then moving onto advanced music sessions. We will continue to use their services as the delivery of their training is of the highest standard not to mention the demand for their workshops and a waiting list throughout the year. Some of the responses received by our attendees are below:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><em>“Never has a workshop inspired me as much as this, I’ve had so much fun not to mention being able to learn new beats, and playing music together whilst learning within a group”</em></p>

<p><em>“I think it was well organised and no improvement needed”</em></p>

<p><em>“Excellent resources, hands on, good fun, informative, new ideas, good to experience instruments I probably would not see at school”</em></p>

<p><em>“Seeing the different types of instruments and ideas of how to use everyday things to make music”</em></p>

<p><em>“Hands on and practical, mostly courses are just verbal but this enables you to go away with practical ideas”</em></p>

<p><em>“Perfect! No improvement needed”</em></p>

<p><em>“Fantastic facilitators, very hands on and brilliant. More! More! More!”</em></p>  
</blockquote>
   

<p>These are just some of the positive feedback we have received!!</p>

<p>Thanks very much to Angela and Storme from EarthSong Music.</p>

<p>All the best</p>
